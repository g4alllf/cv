        #   Optimal allocation of reservior is closely related to economic and livelihood issues. Therefore, it's very important to formulate a reasonable allocation scheme to meet the regional demand.
        # description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
        #     In reservior optimal operation, there are often problems of too many variables and too complex relationship between objectives, which makes it difficult for us to formulate a reasonable reservior operation strategy. In this contest, we proposed an optimal reservior scheduling scheme, and demonstrated the feasibility of the scheme. It's a great honor for our proposal to be nominated for the Finalist of the 2022 MCM Competition(Top 1% of all participants).

    I'm a junior student in [the School of Software Engineering](https://sse.sysu.edu.cn/page/321) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/). I'm currently doing some research on AI security in the TAI lab in the School of Software Engineering under the supervision of Assistant Professor [Weibin Wu](https://sse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/249), and my research is on evaluating deep learning model robustness through adversarial attacks, with the goal of improving AI security.

    If you have any questions, please contact me via email.

            This project is based on the actix web framework. The project combines the features of the rust language to implement the online judge project backend that supports asynchronous calls and can compile the rust language and read sql database content in real time.

            The front end of the project uses the Ant Design UI library, combined with the pluggable enterprise-class react application framework umi, to achieve the interface UI design and project convention-based routing. The project's back end uses SpringBoot to handle HTTP interactions and the MyBatis framework to generate and eventually execute sql statements.

        #   Optimal allocation of reservior is closely related to economic and livelihood issues. Therefore, it's very important to formulate a reasonable allocation scheme to meet the regional demand.
        # description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
        #     In reservior optimal operation, there are often problems of too many variables and too complex relationship between objectives, which makes it difficult for us to formulate a reasonable reservior operation strategy. In this contest, we proposed an optimal reservior scheduling scheme, and demonstrated the feasibility of the scheme. It's a great honor for our proposal to be nominated for the Finalist of the 2022 MCM Competition(Top 1% of all participants).
